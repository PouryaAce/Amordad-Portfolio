        Delving with all their force into the psychedelic world of electronic
        music, the bros have always been passionate about electronic music since
        early teenage years, mainly influenced by artists such as Astrix, Yahel,
        Astral Projection. After their journey to down under land and
        discovering the Australian underground scene, they have been dedicated
        to share their love and passion for psytrance music and culture, playing
        an active role in promoting a variety of events, they are the main force
        behind Psytribe Sydney. Hammering out seriously heart pounding
        psychedelia which is a result of their melodic,old school background,
        infused with todays powerful and groovy basslines , the duo love it when
        launching the floor into a frenzy that takes the audience to a deep
        journey, helping refresh the mind and soul while the body floates on
        their frequency. Delivering their own sound since early 2019, along with
        forefront music from around the world to the dancefloors, brings out a
        solid aura that always makes it an unforgettable experience to be there
        and enjoy the devine moment of now.
